Generate a UNIQUE, specific, and marketable Digital Product 2.0 idea.
The idea MUST be based on real-world demand and target a unique type of person with a specific, painful problem and strong motivation to buy.
Avoid general, vague, or recycled course topics. Be niche, surprising, and psychologically sharp.

For example:
- "Reboot Your Brain in 90 Days: A Neuroplasticity Plan for Adults with ADHD Who Feel Mentally Burnt Out"
- "Fix Your Knees at Home: A Digital Program for Elderly People Struggling With Chronic Joint Pain"
- "Write Your First Childrenâ€™s Book in 7 Days: For Stay-at-Home Moms With a Creative Side and No Writing Experience"

Provide the output in the following JSON format:
{
  "niche": "Exact type of person targeted (e.g., 'Adults with ADHD who feel mentally burnt out')",
  "coreProblem": "The painful, urgent, and real problem they face (e.g., 'Constant mental fog, inability to focus, and feeling overwhelmed by daily tasks due to ADHD burnout')",
  "transformationOutcome": "What the product promises as a result (e.g., 'Regained mental clarity, improved focus, and sustainable strategies to manage ADHD symptoms and prevent burnout')",
  "productIdeaName": "A compelling and descriptive name for the digital product (e.g., 'ADHD Brain Reboot: 90-Day Neuroplasticity Plan')",

}

Ensure the JSON is valid and complete. Do not include any text outside the JSON object itself. The JSON should start with { and end with }.
